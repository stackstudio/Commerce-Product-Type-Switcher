# Commerce Product Type Switcher

*NB this plugin assumes you have the same fields setup on each product type*

A lotof users on Craft Commerce have been asking for the ability to switch product types on the actual product itself. There is a simple way of doing it but it requires some db fiddling which can be dangerous if you have a client site that has high activity and admins changing product data on an hourly basis.

What this plugin aims to do is allow anyone to select a product type in the product admin cp edit page and use that to swap the product type manually.
